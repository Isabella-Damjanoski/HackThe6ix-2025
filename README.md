# ü©∫ DrawDx - Draw Your Pain, Discover the Cause

**Winner of Best Healthcare Innovation at HackThe6ix 2025** üèÜ

DrawDx is an AI-powered pain assessment tool that allows users to draw their pain locations on an interactive body diagram and receive intelligent analysis of possible conditions and recommendations.

## üéØ Project Overview

**Problem:** Patients struggle to effectively communicate their pain to healthcare providers, leading to miscommunication, delays in diagnosis, and inefficient care.

**Solution:** DrawDx bridges the communication gap by providing an intuitive visual interface where patients can:
- Draw pain locations on an interactive body diagram
- Specify pain intensity and type
- Receive AI-powered analysis of possible conditions
- Generate shareable reports for healthcare providers

- **Pain Intensity Levels**: Mild, Moderate, Severe with color-coded visualization
- **Pain Type Selection**: Sharp, Dull, Burning, Throbbing, Cramping, Tingling
- **Real-time Drawing**: Smooth drawing experience with undo/clear functionality

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Analysis
- **Anatomical Region Mapping**: Automatically maps drawn areas to anatomical structures
- **Condition Hypothesis**: Generates possible medical conditions with likelihood percentages
- **Treatment Recommendations**: Provides immediate care suggestions and follow-up guidance
- **Medical Disclaimer**: Clear boundaries about the tool's educational purpose

### üìä Professional Reporting
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Detailed analysis with anatomical structures and conditions
